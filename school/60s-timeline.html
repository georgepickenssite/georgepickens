            <b>The assassination of John F. Kennedy (1963)</b><br>
            On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated while riding in a motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas, at 12:30 PM. He was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine, who was arrested shortly after but was killed by nightclub owner Jack Ruby just two days later while in police custody. The assassination shocked the nation and led to widespread conspiracy theories, although the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald acted alone in the tragic event that ended Kennedy's presidency and profoundly impacted American history.

            Designed to eliminate barriers to voting for African Americans, particularly in the South, this act marked a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement. The Act prohibited practices such as literacy tests and mandated federal oversight of voter registration and elections in jurisdictions with a history of voter suppression. Over the years, it has been reauthorized multiple times to strengthen protections for all minority voters.

            <b>Vietnam War Escalation</b><br>
            On August 7, 1964,The U.S. significantly escalated its military involvement in Vietnam. Following the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (1964), U.S. military involvement significantly increased, leading to widespread anti-war protests and changing public sentiment. This resolution was prompted by reported attacks on U.S. Navy ships by North Vietnamese forces, leading to increased troop deployments and the initiation of large-scale military operations, including the notorious "Operation Rolling Thunder." As a result, the United States rapidly transitioned from advisory roles to full combat engagement, marking a pivotal moment in the Vietnam War that set the stage for a prolonged and intentional conflict.

            This incident escalated U.S. involvement in Vietnam and led to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which resulted in greater military action in Southeast Asia. The Gulf of Tonkin Incident involved two separate confrontations between North Vietnamese forces and U.S. naval vessels, notably the destroyer USS Maddox, occurring from August 2 to August 4, 1964. The U.S. government characterized these encounters as unprovoked attacks, which led to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. Later investigations revealed that the second alleged attack on August 4 may never have occurred, raising significant doubts about the justification for deeper engagement in the Vietnam War.

            Betty Friedan's groundbreaking book sparked the second wave of feminism, leading to increased awareness of women's rights and gender equality. In "The Feminine Mystique," Betty Friedan explores the common dissatisfactions among women in post-war America. Arguing that societal expectations confine women to roles of wife and mother, which often leads to a sense of unfulfillment known as "the problem that has no name." She criticizes how media, education, and psychological theories reinforce this "feminine mystique," promoting the belief that true femininity is found solely in domesticity. The book is a catalyst for the second wave of feminism, encouraging women to seek personal fulfillment outside traditional roles and to reclaim their identities through education and career opportunities.
